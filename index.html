    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is when computers or machines are designed to think and act like humans. It’s like teaching machines to solve problems, learn from experience, and even make decisions.</p>

    <h2>How Does AI Work?</h2>
    <p>AI works by using something called algorithms. These are special instructions that help a computer learn from information (called data). The more data the computer has, the better it can learn and make decisions, just like how we learn from books and practice!</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Our Daily Lives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa use AI to help you with tasks like setting reminders and answering questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> YouTube and Netflix use AI to suggest videos or shows you might like based on what you’ve watched before.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Driving Cars:</strong> Some cars use AI to drive themselves, with little or no help from humans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is AI Important?</h2>
    <p>AI is important because it helps us solve problems quickly and do things more efficiently. It can also do tasks that are too difficult or dangerous for people, like exploring space or cleaning the oceans.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In simple terms, AI is about making computers smarter so they can help us in many ways. As technology grows, AI will play an even bigger role in our future!</p>
